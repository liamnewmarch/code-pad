#Fiddle

_A HTML / CSS / JS sandbox that works offline and between page refreshes._

This project gives you the ability to write HTML, CSS and Javascript to quickly test your ideas.

Try it for yourself here [fiddle.liamnewmarch.co.uk](http://fiddle.liamnewmarch.co.uk)

## Persistent

Fiddle uses localStorage to store your data between browser refreshes. At present you can only store one Fiddle. In addition, there is not currently a way of sharing Fiddles between computers.

## Offline-capable

Thanks to the appcache manifest file, you can modify the contents of your Fiddle even when you have no internet connection. Because the Fiddle is stored in localStorage, an internet connection isn't required to save either.
